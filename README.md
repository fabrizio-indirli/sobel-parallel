# Parallel Algorithms project
Implementation of parallelization strategies on a image processing application (Grey, Sobel and Blur filters) using MPI, OpenMP & CUDA.
The original (sequential) program was modified in order to exploit the 3 parallelization technologies: the final program infers the best strategy according to the input set and to the available resources, using a decision tree.
